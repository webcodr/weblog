This a follow up article to [Awesome CLI tools]({{< ref "2024-03-06_cli-tools.md" >}}) with even more useful CLI tools. 

## btop

It's `top` on steroids with a beautiful terminal UI. Way more information at a glance and just a joy to use.

## delta

Do you often look at git diffs? Are you missing syntax highlighting? `delta` is here to help. Just install it, configure delta as pager for git and voila, diffs with syntax highlighting.

## dog

Dog is a modern DNS lookup tool with colored output and a simple interface.

## tokei

Are you a fan of statistics? Tokei can summarize file types, lines of code, comments or blank spaces of your project.

I'm currently converting a large Java project to Kotlin and tokei makes it easy to see the progress.

## procs

A modern replacement for `ps` with colored output, keyword search, tree view and some useful helpers for networking (ports) and Docker.

## lazygit

One of my favorites. Lazygit is a dead simple, yet powerful and elegant to use terminal UI for git. I'm not a fan of the git CLI and always preferred a GUI tool like Tower, but nowadays lazygit is my git client of choice. I don't think there is better git client out there. Even many NeoVim distributions support it out-of-the-box (Lazyvim with `LEADER` + `gg`).

## sd

Do you use `sed`? Do you like it? I don't. `sd` is better, much better.
