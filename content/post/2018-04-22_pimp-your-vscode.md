Like VS Code? Yeah, me too. Here are some very useful extensions and optical enhancements to get an even better experience with VS Code.

## Extensions

### Settings Sync

I love my Mac, but sometimes I have to do stuff (besides gaming) on my Windows PC as well. So, if I want to use the same config on both devices, I have to install my extensions and copy my config back and forth. That sucks. Settings Sync to the rescue! It syncs your settings, extensions etc. through the power of Gists on GitHub.

### Bookmarks

It's quite simple: just bookmark certain lines of code you need often.

### EditorConfig for VS Code

Share your coding styles between editors, IDEs etc. on a per project basis. It's really nice for teams as well.

## Themes/Icons

### Cobalt2

If you like darker and bluish color themes, give Cobalt2 a try. The color choices with a contrast between yellow and blue can reduce strain on your eyes.

### Material Icon Theme

Matches nicely with Cobalt2 or other darker themes. There are a ton of icons for almost any file type and even for many special folders like `node_modules` etc.

But that's not the end. VS Code can do much more, you can find some other very useful tips and tricks on [vscodecandothat.com](https://vscodecandothat.com/).

## Dear GitHub

Look, I want to like Atom, but there are too many caveats. Atom is slow and resource hungry as hell, which is especially bad on a mobile device. It literally eats my MacBook's battery away. VS Code is not perfect either, but the general experience is much better. So, please, get your shit together and improve Atom. We need more awesome editors on the market!
